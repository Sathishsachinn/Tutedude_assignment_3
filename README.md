Problem 1: Factorial of a Number

#Description
This program calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user.
The factorial logic is implemented using a function and a loop.

### Features

* Takes input from the user
* Uses a function named `factorial`
* Handles negative number input
* Displays the factorial result

### How It Works

1. The user enters a number.
2. The number is passed to the `factorial()` function.
3. The function calculates the factorial using a loop.
4. The result is returned and printed.

### Sample Output

Enter a number: 5
The factorial of 5 is: 120

## Problem 2: Mathematical Operations Using `math` Module

### Description

This program uses Python’s built-in `math` module to calculate:

* Square root
* Natural logarithm (log base e)
* Sine value (in radians)

### Features

* Accepts a number from the user
* Uses `math.sqrt()`, `math.log()`, and `math.sin()`
* Displays all calculated results clearly

### How It Works

1. The user inputs a number.
2. The program performs mathematical calculations using the `math` module.
3. The results are printed to the console.

### Sample Output

Enter a number: 4
Square root of 4.0: 2.0
Natural logarithm of 4.0: 1.3862943611198906
Sine of 4.0 (in radians): -0.7568024953079282
